# Web-EDA

Problem Scenario: We have a set of email campaigns for an advertiser who had a steady number of opens and
click-throughs historically. However, after pulling a monthly summary report, we found that ad
clicks were significantly higher than normal. Using the summary report below and raw data files
provided for those campaigns
1. Identify the possible cause(s) of increase of ad clicks.
2. After identifying the issue, what kind of suggestions can you provide for possible
solutions to this problem for future campaigns?
3. Optional: Are there any other findings that you were able to identify during this
analysis? If so, what are they?

Note: Each campaign consists of two raw data files because they run in two phases. 1st send is
sent to the whole audience and 2nd send is sent only to those who didn’t open the 1st send.

Data Analysis Synopsis: Email Campaign Performance
Advertiser: Steady historical opens and click-throughs
Possible Cause: The use of URL placeholders appears to be lowering the open rate percentage, potentially impacting the true effectiveness of the campaigns.
Explanation:
The analysis suggests that while the total number of ad clicks is increasing, this doesn't necessarily reflect a genuine rise in user engagement. Here's why:
1.	URL Placeholders and Open Rates: Including URL placeholders in emails might cause a decrease in the open rate percentage. This could be because some email providers might flag emails with placeholders as spam or potentially harmful, leading to them being filtered or not being opened at all.
2.	Unique Opens vs. Total Opens: The report mentions an increase in total opens alongside a decrease in unique opens. This indicates that the same individuals might be opening the emails multiple times, potentially due to the repetitive nature of the content or the way the email is being displayed.
3.	Misleading Clicks: The rise in total ad clicks could be attributed to the multiple opens by the same individuals rather than a genuine increase in unique user interaction with the advertised content.
Possible Causes of Increased Ad Clicks
The data suggests two possible explanations for the observed increase in ad clicks:
1.	Decreased Open Rates due to URL Placeholders: The data reveals a concurrent decrease in open rates alongside the rise in ad clicks. This pattern implies that URL placeholders potentially reduce email appeal, leading to fewer overall openings.
2.	Increased Re-engagement with Repeated Sends: A closer look at click-through rates for the first and second sends within the April 14th and 16th campaigns unveils a significant increase in clicks for the second sends. This suggests that the follow-up message might have re-engaged some recipients who disregarded the initial email.
Additional Observations
•	The total number of delivered emails remained consistent throughout the campaign.
•	While the total number of opens fluctuated, the number of unique opens showed a steady decline.
•	This suggests that a smaller group of recipients might repeatedly open the emails, potentially contributing to the higher click-through rates.
Possible Solutions:
•	Track Unique Clicks: Instead of relying on total ad clicks, track unique ad clicks to gauge advertiser engagement.
•	Analyze the content and timing of the second send emails. Consider segmenting the audience based on open behavior. 
Overall, the analysis indicates that the increase in ad clicks likely stems from a combination of factors:
•	Reduced open rates potentially caused by less appealing emails due to URL placeholders.
•	Increased re-engagement with recipients opening subsequent sends within a campaign.
